# ============================================================
#  PRACTICE p03 -- Ringing Up the Till
#  The Cozy Bean  |  M1-W1 Lab01
#
#  YOUR TASK:
#    Ring up an order of 3 lattes (3.50 each) and 2 muffins
#    (2.25 each). Then answer two shop questions: you baked 26
#    muffins and box them by the dozen -- how many are left
#    over? And the "double double double" promo is 2 to the
#    power of 3. Finish by proving the till multiplies before
#    it adds.
#
#  WHEN YOU ARE DONE, running this file should print EXACTLY:
#    Latte line: 10.5
#    Muffin line: 4.5
#    Order total: 15.0
#    Muffins left over: 2
#    Promo cups: 8
#    2 + 3 * 5 = 17
#    (2 + 3) * 5 = 25
#
#  HINT: % gives you what is LEFT OVER after dividing, and **
#        raises a number to a power.
#
#  How to run it: python practice/p03_till_math.py
#                 (run it from inside the M1-W1-Lab01 folder)
#
#  Stuck? The answer is in solutions/p03_till_math.py -- but
#  give it a real try first. The struggle makes it stick.
