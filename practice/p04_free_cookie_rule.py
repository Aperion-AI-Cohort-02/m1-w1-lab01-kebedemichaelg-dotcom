# ============================================================
#  PRACTICE p04 -- The Free Cookie Rule
#  The Cozy Bean  |  M1-W1 Lab01
#
#  YOUR TASK:
#    The rule at the counter: you get a free cookie if you are
#    a loyalty member AND your order is over $10.
#      Sara IS a member and her order is $12.50.
#      Ben is NOT a member and his order is $7.00.
#    Work out the answers for both, using NAMED jars for each
#    question so the rule reads like English. Also work out
#    whether Ben should be invited to sign up.
#
#  WHEN YOU ARE DONE, running this file should print EXACTLY:
#    Sara is a member: True
#    Sara has a big order: True
#    Sara gets a free cookie: True
#    Ben is a member: False
#    Ben has a big order: False
#    Ben gets a free cookie: False
#    Ben should be invited to sign up: True
#
#  HINT: a comparison such as  order_total > 10  hands back
#        True or False all by itself -- no if needed.
#
#  How to run it: python practice/p04_free_cookie_rule.py
#                 (run it from inside the M1-W1-Lab01 folder)
#
#  Stuck? The answer is in solutions/p04_free_cookie_rule.py --
#  but give it a real try first. The struggle makes it stick.
